Welcome to my freecodecamp repository!

JavaScript is the most popular language right now. If you want to be a developer/engineer, you cannot even think of skipping it. Type in Google "What is the most popular language as per Stackoverflow?", It says JavaScript!!

This is my HTML5-CSS3-JavaScript coding repo, I did some JQuery, Responsive design using bootstrap and lot more, please check. Thanks to freecodecamp for all its services for free.

Constant leaner,
